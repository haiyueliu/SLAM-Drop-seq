## Estimation of gene-specific mRNA kinetics along the cell cycle using SLAM-Drop-seq
2
​
3
This pipeline aims to process the SLAM-Drop-seq data for the use of estimation of RNA kinetic rates in single cells along the cell cycle.
4
​
5
### Getting Started
6
​
7
You will need DropseqTools. See Dropseq Tools [Drop-seq GitHub Pages](https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/releases).
8
​
9
You also need to downlaod our scripts used in the pipeline to your local machine.
10
​
11
```
12
## download our scripts using git clone 
13
git clone
14
```
15
​
16
### Processing data
17
​
18
#### 1. Generate annotations from gtf file
19
​
20
Generate exon and intron bed files from gtf annotation.
21
​
22
```
23
sh prepare_annotation_files.sh 
24
```
25
​
26
#### 2. Modify the config yaml file
27
​
28
```
29
## change the directories and parameters in the config.yaml file to your own settings
30
## move to the working folder, load the config.yaml, samples.tsv and snake files here.
31
## prepare subfolers: 1. fastq: contain all the sequenced reads as fastq format; 2. output: the path for all the ourput files generated by this pipeline
32
```
33
​
34
#### 3. Process data 
35
​
36
The data processing pipeline includes the main Drop-seq pipeline, annotating the unique feature(gene) the reads mapped to, annotating the splice status, annotating mismatches, merging reads from the same UMI, and identifing true mismatches from sequencing errors.
37
​
38
```
39
snakemake --cores N -s Snakefile_data_processing
40
​
41
```
42
​
43
#### 4. Identify background conversions and calculate 4sU incorporation rate
44
​
45
This R script only needs to be run once using the no-4sU and 24h-4sU samples. Once you have identified the background conversion rate and 4sU incorporation rate in your experiment, you can omit this step.
